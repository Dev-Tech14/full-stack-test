1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add if you had more time?

=>I spent around 8â€“10 hours on the coding test, including planning, backend setup, responsive design, and refining UI to match the design.

If I had more time, I would:

- Refactor JS and PHP code for better modularity and reusability.

- Implement image upload and preview via admin interface instead of manually adding image paths.

- Add form validation and error handling for all CRUD operations.

- Add pagination and filtering if the section list grows.

- Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation.

- Add animation transitions for smoother slider changes.

2. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

=> Yes, I have tracked performance issues in WordPress and custom PHP-based systems.

My approach:

- Identify the symptom: Slow page load, memory error, etc.

- Check server logs (error_log, access_log) and enable performance logs.

- Browser DevTools to identify long-loading assets.

- Measure DB queries using EXPLAIN in MySQL or plugins like Query Monitor.

- Check external API response times or image/media sizes.

- Fix bottlenecks: Optimize queries, use caching, lazy-load images, minify assets.
